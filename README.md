# Tomorrow Night Rusty 

An unofficial dark VS Code theme inspired by code snippets from The Rust Programming Language (“The Book”) and Rust By Example.
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/

This is a personal project — I originally made this VS Code theme for myself and later decided to publish it.

Supports most popular programming languages (C/C++, Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, Java, C# and more).
